# Sentiment-Anlysis-Fake-News-Classifier
This paper uses Recurrent Neural Networks to build a model that can detect fake news by reading texts. The “fake news”trend is an extremely pressing issue in our lives currently. Media can alter facts and present the public with untrue facts and that can affect the reader’s opinions. Its effects can be something as simple as an online shopper buying a product advertised by false information or something like the 2016 elections (which is said to be altered by fake news and social media). A kaggle news classification dataset was used to train our model and achieve an accuracy of 96%. The same model was then run with another kaggle twitter sentiment analysis data to perform sentiment analysis on texts. The model had an accuracy of 78% and can detect if a text or tweet is POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.
